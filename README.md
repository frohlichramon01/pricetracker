# pricetracker

This is a Amazon Price Tracker;

DISCLAIMER: This is just for studying purposes;

This Price Tracker uses REQUESTS, BEAUTIFULSOUP and the GOOGLE SHEETS API to get the price from the product page, organizes it and register in a Google Spreadsheet.

HOW TO USE:
First, you will need to create a Google Spreadsheet in your driver and save the ID (which is in the spreadsheet link, right after ".../d/" and before "/edit". It looks like a random code;

Then, you will need do read the Google API documentation, to download your "credentials.json" and put it in the root folder:
https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python

Last, you need to enter the values for the empty commented variables in the app.py.



PS: This Price Tracker can track two products at the same time.
